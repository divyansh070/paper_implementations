# 🧪 ML Playground: Model Testing & Learning Lab

Welcome to my personal sandbox for experimenting with machine learning models, architectures, and ideas. This repo serves as a living lab where I test, break, debug, and learn—one model at a time.

## 🚀 Purpose

This repository is a collection of:
- 📚 Hands-on experiments with various machine learning and deep learning models.
- 🧠 Notes, learnings, and interesting patterns discovered during model development.
- 🔬 A playground for trying out ideas from research papers, Kaggle notebooks, and tutorials.

Whether it's fine-tuning a transformer, testing a new optimizer, or just comparing models on toy datasets—this is the place.

## ✨ What's Inside

- ✅ Implementations of popular and experimental ML/DL models
- 📊 Evaluation scripts and visualization utilities
- 📝 Notes and insights as markdown files
- 🔄 Frequent changes and updates (this is *not* a stable repo)
